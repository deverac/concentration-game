## Concentration memory game

This is the classic memory game. Cards are laid out face down in a grid. Two (or
three) cards are turned over cards at a time. If the cards match, they are left
face up, otherwise they are flipped so that they are face down. This process is
repeated until all cards are face up.

Features:
 * A timer and move counter.
 * Match two cards or three cards.
 * Animated or 'instant' flip.
 * Several designs for card backs.
 * Up to 54 cards.
 * Single file app (no dependencies or external files).

When playing, the 'Home' button must be pressed twice in order to return to the
Home screen; this avoids accidentally clicking it while playing.
